Welcome to Connectopic Mapping's documentation!
===============================================

This packacge contains the tools to extract a connectopic mapping of the brain from resting state fMRI data. The pipeline used is based on Haak and colleagues' paper "Connectopic Mapping with resting state fMRI", 2016.

The package is divided in two modules:

* **haak** contains the code to run Haak's pipeline;
* **utils** contains static functions that can be used to manipulate and visualize data in the same format understood by *haak*.
